Feel free to contact me if you have questions beyond this help file.




1. In the "Assets" folder you will find an .obj file that will export into just about any 3d package. You will also find a max file that was created in 3ds Max 2010 that has the model in it as well.

2. In the "Presentation" Folder are the pictures from 3d ocean when viewing the pack.

3.My naming convention for texture maps that is consistant throughout each pack you buy is as follows...

ObjectName_MapType

Map Type abbreviation break down

df = Diffuse Map
nm = Normal Map
sp = Specular Map
gl = Emissive Map or "Glow" Map

The opacity map (if there is one) is stored in the alpha channel of the Diffuse as it is a 32 bit file.





Now off you go! Create a massive dungeon level! Or... Go buy all the other parts so that you can. ;) To see what you can create with all 20 packs I put the final render in the Presentation Folder.

If you do something cool. Like make it playable in an engine, or improve upon it... I would love to see. ;)
